There are multiple possible timer sources which could be useful for
the sound stream synchronization: hrtimers, hardware clocks (e.g. PTP),
timer wheels (jiffies). Currently, using one of them to synchronize
the audio stream of snd-aloop module would require writing a
kernel-space driver which exports an ALSA timer through the
snd_timer interface.

However, it is not really convenient for application developers, who may
want to define their custom timer sources for audio synchronization.

For instance, we could have a network application which receives frames
and sends them to snd-aloop pcm device, and another application
listening on the other end of snd-aloop. It makes sense to transfer a
new period of data only when certain amount of frames is received
through the network, but definitely not when a certain amount of jiffies
on a local system elapses. Since all of the devices are purely virtual
it won't introduce any glitches and will help the application developers
to avoid using sample-rate conversion.

This patch series introduces userspace-driven ALSA timers: virtual
timers which are created and controlled from userspace. The timer can
be created from the userspace using the new ioctl SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_CREATE.
After creating a timer, it becomes available for use system-wide, so it
can be passed to snd-aloop as a timer source (timer_source parameter
would be "-1.SNDRV_TIMER_GLOBAL_UDRIVEN.{timer_id}"). When the userspace
app decides to trigger a timer, it calls another ioctl
SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_TRIGGER on the file descriptor of a timer. It
initiates a transfer of a new period of data.

Userspace-driven timers are associated with file descriptors. If the
application wishes to destroy the timer, it can simply release the file
descriptor of a virtual timer.

I believe introducing new ioctl calls is quite inconvenient (as we have
a limited amount of them), but other possible ways of app <-> kernel
communication (like virtual FS) seem completely inappropriate for this
task (but I'd love to discuss alternative solutions).

This patch series also updates the snd-aloop module so the global timers
can be used as a timer_source for it (it allows using userspace-driven
timers as timer source).

V2 of this patch series fixes some problems found by Christophe Jaillet
<christophe.jaillet@wanadoo.fr>. Please, find the patch-specific
changelog in the following patches.
